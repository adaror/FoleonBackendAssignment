  <p align="center">Backend Assignment for Foleon </p>

## Description

In this project I designed a service responsible for 3 entities - Projects, documents and Elements.
This is a POC, In this project I implemented routes for creating, updated and deleting new Projects and the same for Documents.
While creating Documents, you also pass list of Elements reflecting the type and the order of elements in each Document.

## Design

** Explanation **
**Projects table:** This table will store information about each project. Each project will have a unique ID, name, creation date, and any other relevant attributes. The ID will serve as the primary key for this table. 

**Documents table:** This table will store information about each document associated with a project. Each document will have a unique ID, name, creation and update date, and any other relevant attributes. 

**Elements table** This table will store information about each element associated with a document. Each element will have a unique ID, type (Button, Image or Text) and any other relevant attributes. 

**DocumentElements table:**
By using the DocumentElements table, we can represent the many-to-many relationship between documents and elements while also preserving the order of the elements within each document.
